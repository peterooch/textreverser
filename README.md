textreverser
============

a little project in winforms
Gets text from a file/input/paste, reverses the characters, then gives options to copy or to save to a file...
issue:
currently reverses everything! also lines, so the first line is the last one etc... will be fixed.
support currently text files in unicode only(UTF-x ...) not ansi.
this is my first hobby programming project that have results.
have fun!
